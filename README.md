A toy application used to order pizza from fictional pizza service Sundevil Pizza. Created as a semester-long group project for ASU's CSE 360 class (Introduction to Software Engineering). 

As a college student, you'll be able to place orders with just a few clicks, choosing from a variety of delicious toppings and sauces to customize your perfect pie. Pizzeria employees can then process these orders and send them to the kitchen, where chef employees can see exactly what needs to be made.

Created using the Agile framework.
